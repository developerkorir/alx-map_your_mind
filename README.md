1. Order marches with weighty and measured strides. Disorder is always in a hurry.
To develop an algorithm that

reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order

you are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.

2. It is not enough to run; one must start in time
To develop an algorithm

Calculate a running sum

A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result

you are going to create a flow chart and pseudo code.
